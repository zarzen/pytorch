# Our strategy is to retrieve the parent workflow run, then filter its jobs on
# RUNNER_NAME to figure out which job we're currently running.
#
# Why RUNNER_NAME? Because it's the only thing that uniquely identifies a job within a workflow.
# GITHUB_JOB doesn't work, as it corresponds to the job yaml id
# (https://bit.ly/37e78oI), which has two problems:
# 1. It's not present in the workflow job JSON object, so we can't use it as a filter.
# 2. It isn't unique; for matrix jobs the job yaml id is the same for all jobs in the matrix.
#
# RUNNER_NAME on the other hand is unique across the pool of runners. Also,
# since only one job can be scheduled on a runner at a time, we know that
# looking for RUNNER_NAME will uniquely identify the job we're currently
# running.
